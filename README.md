# VAMOOS
Repository for Visual Analytics of Multi-Objective Optimization Solutions
In this repository you will find functions that will help you visualize results of MOO problems.
Functions include the possibility to:

- PlotObjectivesMv2   : Plot all 2D tradeoffs among Objective Functions, allowing brushing
- PlotObjectives3DMv2 : Plot all 3D tradeoffs among Objective Functions, allowing brushing
- PlotOFParallel      : Plot of Parallel Coordinates, allowing brushing
- level_diagram       : Plot of level diagram for Objective Functions
- tradeoff_index      : Plot of trade-off index mosaic for Objective Functions
- HRV_method          : Plot of Hyper-Radial norm of Objective Functions (<a href="https://github.com/mariocastrogama/VAMOOS/blob/master/HRV.png">Example</a>)
- OFspace             : Plot of Objective Space as function of Decision Variables (still under development)
- Some additional functions useful for creating colorbars, colormaps and other stuff.

It includes tests for:
- PlotObjectivesMv2
- PlotObjectives3DMv2
- PlotOFParallel
- level_diagram
- tradeoff_index
- HRV_method
- OFspace (still under development)
