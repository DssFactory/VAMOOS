# VAMOOS
Repository for Visual Analytics of Multi-Objective Optimization Solutions
In this repository you will find functions that will help you visualize results of MOO problems.
Functions include the possibility to:

- Plot all 2D tradeoffs among Objective Functions
- Plot all 3D tradeoffs among Objective Functions
- Plot of Parallel Coordinates
- Plot of level diagram for Objective Functions
- Plot of trade-off mosaic for Objective Functions
- Plot of Hyper-Radial norm of Objective Functions
- Plot of Objective Space as function of Decision Variables
- Some additional functions useful for creating colorbars, colormaps and other stuff.

It includes tests for:
- PlotObjectivesMv2
- PlotObjectives3DMv2
- PlotOFParallel
- level_diagram
- HRV_method
- OFspace*


* Still under development
